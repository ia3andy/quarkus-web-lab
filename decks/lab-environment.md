## Getting your environment ready

To get the most out of this lab, make sure you have the following working on your workstation:

 - JDK (17+)
 - Git
 - IDE

### JDK

Choose any JDK, example:

 - [Red Hat OpenJDK](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download)
 - [Oracle OpenJDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

 After you installed the JDK, make sure java is available on your Path, example:

 ```sh
$ java -version
openjdk version "21.0.3" 2024-04-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Red_Hat-21.0.3.0.9-1) (build 21.0.3+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Red_Hat-21.0.3.0.9-1) (build 21.0.3+9, mixed mode, sharing)
 ```

 ### Git

 Install Git (to get the code from the lab, alternatively, you can download the starter project as a zip from GitHub)

 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

 You can test your git by checking the version:

 ```sh
 $ git -v
git version 2.45.0
 ```
